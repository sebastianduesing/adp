This repository contains code to normalize free-text data using a three-stage method that
applies standardization at the level of characters, words, and phrases. Character
standardization is most generic; phrase standardization is most dataset-specific. The
normalization rules used by ADP are designed to be easily adapted to the needs of the
dataset to be normalized. Included in this repository are two datasets containing age and
data-location free-text data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB).

The script normalize.py performs the core normalization functions in ADP, but the scripts/
directory contains several other scripts that provide accessory functions and perform data
collection and analysis on the outputs of the normalization process.

Using the makefile to run ADP code is recommended, as most scripts involved take several
arguments.
