THIS IS OUTDATED AND WILL BE UPDATED SOON

This repository contains code to normalize and process free-text data. Contained here is one
dataset from the Immune Epitope Database which contains age data and to which this version of
the code is tailored.

The normalization code follows a three-stage method that corrects variance on the levels of
characters, words, and phrases. Character correction is most generic; phrase correction is
most dataset-specific. Word- and phrase-based correction methods used in ADP are designed to
be easily adapted to other datasets.

Using the makefile to run ADP code is recommended, as most scripts involved take several
arguments.

- "make normalize" runs normalize.py on an initial input file.
- "make sort" runs sort_age.py and make_curation_tsv.py. Any new data in manual_curation.tsv
  should be curated before proceeding to the next step.
- "make merge" merges manually curated rows from manual_curation.tsv with automatically sorted
  rows in age_sorted.tsv.
- "make final" runs final_processing.py, which applies some post-processing steps and
  calculates a score representing confidence in the sorting of each data item.
- "make full" runs all of the above.

Everything following the normalization step is tailored specifically to the age dataset and
is likely not applicable in its current form to any other dataset. While the normalization
code's parameters are adapted to suit the needs of the age dataset, normalize.py is designed
to make it easy to configure it for other datasets.
